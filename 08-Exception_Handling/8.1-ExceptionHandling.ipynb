    "## Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program. This mechanism helps in preventing program crashes and provides a way to manage errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Python Exception Handling\n",
    "**Exception:** \n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. It typically occurs when Python runs into an error during execution (e.g., division by zero, accessing an undefined variable, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try-Except Block:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` block is the primary way to handle exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally Block:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` block allows you to define code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It’s usually used for cleanup actions like closing files or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Else Block:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` block is executed if the code in the try block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raising Exceptions:** \n",
    "\n",
    "You can manually raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword."
