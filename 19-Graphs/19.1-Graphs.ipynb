    "## Introduction to Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of **nodes** (also called **vertices**) and **edges** that connect pairs of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are widely used to model real-world relationships such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social networks (people and friendships)\n",
    "- Maps (cities and roads)\n",
    "- Computer networks (devices and connections)\n",
    "- Web pages and hyperlinks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common terms used in graph theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex (Node)**: A fundamental unit or point in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge (Link)**: A connection between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacent Vertices**: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Degree of a Vertex**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Undirected Graph**: Number of edges connected to the vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Directed Graph**:\n",
    "    - **In-degree**: Number of incoming edges.\n",
    "    - **Out-degree**: Number of outgoing edges.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Path**: A sequence of vertices connected by edges.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Cycle**: A path where the starting and ending vertex are the same.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Connected Graph**: There is a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Strongly Connected Graph**: In a directed graph, there is a path between every pair of vertices in both directions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Disconnected Graph**: At least one pair of vertices has no connecting path.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Weighted Graph**: Each edge has an associated cost or weight.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Unweighted Graph**: All edges are considered to have equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Directed Graph (Digraph)**\n",
    "- Edges have a direction (e.g., A → B).\n",
    "- Order of nodes in an edge matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Undirected Graph**\n",
    "- Edges have no direction (e.g., A — B).\n",
    "- Connection goes both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Weighted Graph**\n",
    "- Each edge has a numerical weight (e.g., distance, cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Unweighted Graph**\n",
    "- All edges are treated equally (no weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Cyclic Graph**\n",
    "- Contains at least one cycle (a path that forms a loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Acyclic Graph**\n",
    "- Contains no cycles.\n",
    "- Example: **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** used in task scheduling, version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Connected Graph**\n",
    "- There is a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Disconnected Graph**\n",
    "- Some vertices are not connected by any path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Complete Graph**\n",
    "- Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Sparse Graph**\n",
    "- Contains relatively few edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Dense Graph**\n",
    "- Contains many edges, close to the maximum possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
