# Python Programming — Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover **basic Python**, **advanced concepts**, and **data structures & algorithms** step-by-step.  
The aim is to provide a practical roadmap from zero to mastery — starting with the basics, then moving into search/sort algorithms, complexity analysis, and dynamic programming.

> Most examples are Jupyter Notebook-based. You can work with VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or any compatible environment.

## Installation

1. **Set up environment**
```bash
# (optional) create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook # or
jupyter lab
```

## How to Use

Follow the folders in numerical order for a structured learning path.

Each folder contains topic explanations + examples + (if available) exercises/practice.

Modify and re-run code cells to experiment — especially with algorithm topics.

For complex data structures, diagrams and flowcharts can help understanding.
