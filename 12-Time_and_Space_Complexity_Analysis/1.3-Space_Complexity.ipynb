    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the size of the input data. It measures how much memory space is needed as the input size grows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity generally consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static Space:** This is the space required for fixed-size data (e.g., variables, constants) and static structures (e.g., arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Space:** This is the space required for data that is created dynamically during the execution of the algorithm (e.g., linked lists, tree structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating Space Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity is typically expressed using big O notation, `O(f(n))`, where `f(n)` represents the amount of memory required as a function of the input size `n`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constant Space:** If an algorithm uses a fixed number of variables, its space complexity is `O(1)` (constant space).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Usage:** An algorithm that uses an array of size `n` requires` O(n)` space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Functions:** A recursive algorithm uses stack space for each function call. If the maximum depth of recursion is `n`, the space complexity is `O(n)`."
