    "- **Average Case:** O(n log n) — This is the typical performance of Quick Sort.\n",

    "- **Worst Case:** O(n²) — The worst-case scenario happens when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element (which leads to unbalanced partitions). This can happen if the array is already sorted and the first or last element is chosen as the pivot.\n",

    "**Optimizations:**\n",
