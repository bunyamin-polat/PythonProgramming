    "## Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a type of iterator that allows you to iterate over data lazily (on-demand), making them more memory-efficient compared to regular iterators. Generators are typically used when dealing with large datasets or streams of data that you don’t want to store in memory all at once. They are defined using the yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a function that behaves like an iterator. Instead of using return to send back a value and terminate, a generator uses yield to send back a value and then pauses the function's execution, maintaining its state until the next value is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generators are iterators because they implement both `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They generate values on the fly instead of storing them in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each time yield is encountered, the function’s state is saved, and execution resumes from that point when next() is called again."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Iterators and generators are powerful tools in Python for creating and handling sequences of data efficiently. Iterators provide a way to access elements sequentially, while generators allow you to generate items on the fly, making them particularly useful for handling large datasets and infinite sequences. \n",
